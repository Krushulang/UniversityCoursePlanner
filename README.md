Overview and Objective
This project was created and conceptualized around the need for more input when planning out courses at UWB. The application itself allows users to select their major and prior taken classes along with optional filters to determine what classes would be suitable to plan for. 
The app aims to fulfill this in a quick and easy way for the user.

Motivation
The main motivation for this project was to aid students when choosing classes to take next quarter. As a student myself, this was always an issue for me. I put all of the ideas I had into this project to simulate the type of service I wish I could have used. 
Advisors are great and preferred, but with busy schedules, an app can be nice to use.

Application
The end product will be able to be used by UWB students to plan their courses. The work will be available on my web app on Azure located at the url: https://uwcourseplanner.azurewebsites.net/. 
The web app may not be available after this projects completion mostly due to the cost and maintenance associated with web services.

Methodology
The project was done through 5 different sprints where multiple deliverable artifacts were created. Some of these include:
Architectural and Activity diagrams
Logical Database diagram
Personas
Prototypes were also incrementally created for sponsor and advisor use.

Challenges
Some of the major challenges of this project included the following:
Creating a web crawler for easy database insertion
Inserting data into the database that couldn’t be web crawled
Getting the connectivity between all the tools

Conclusion
I was able to demonstrate most of the skills and knowledge I’ve learned in the CSSE major at UWB. And I have utilized my learning to develop a web app that anyone at UWB can use to plan courses.
